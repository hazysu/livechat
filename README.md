# Floating Live-Chat

Floating Twitch.tv chat messages. Add the page to your OBS setup to have your Twitch live-chat messages float over your stream.

Go to [hazy.su/livechat/chat?streamer=hasanabi](https://hazy.su/livechat/chat?streamer=hasanabi) for hasanabi's live-chat. Replace the username with the name of your own Twitch channel to view the live-chat of it.

To use this with OBS, add a browser source and set the URL as listed above. If you'd like to change the chat color, add ``&chatcolor=`` followed by a color hex code (Without the hashtag symbol!) to the URL. You can also change how long the messages stay visible for with ``&duration=10`` or any other number.
